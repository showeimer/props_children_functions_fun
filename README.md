## Props, Children, Functions, Fun

This project will provide practice in scaffolding, passing props, passing functions as props, and rendering child components.

In order to get familiar with props, state, passing props to children, and rendering children components, let's fix our application. w

- Use create-react-app to generate a new React application.
- Directly within your new app directory, make a new src directory.
- Within src, make two new directories: components and styles.
- Move App.js into src/components.
- Move App.css into src/styles.
- Copy the starter file App.js into src/components/App.js
- Import the App component into index.js

Use npm run start to get your project going and check for errors.

You will need to execute a few major changes to the App.js file to get everything working properly.

The BaseLayout component should house the Header and Footer components as well as make room for any child components that would be rendered in between.

The ParentComponent has a lot of the functionality worked out for you, but you will need to make it run properly. Namely in the constructor method and the render method where we pass props down.

After everything is working properly, you will need to move each of the components (except for the App component) into their own separate file within src/components and import and export them properly to make the application still run.

- Copy each of the components other than App into their own file within src/components
- Export each component from their individual files.
- Import all of the other components into the files where they are referenced.

The App component should only render a BaseLayout and ParentComponent.

## Results  

The application should run without errors and you should be able to input text and display it in another component after clicking submit. After all functionality is complete you should stylize your application in a theme that you see fit.

Mockup is included in the main directory.
